        <p>This is a hot soup from India made with pineapple and lime juice, enhanced with the flavors of ginger, green chile peppers, and cumin seeds. It smells and tastes so good that you could just keep drinking. Good with rice. Tip: Roll limes against a hard surface with the palm of your hand to make them soft. This helps get the juice out.</p>
